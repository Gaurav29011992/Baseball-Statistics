We Stored the data for each of the Batters , Pitchers and the Fielders on the HDFS using various Store Statements like :

STORE final_table_ERA INTO '/user/gxd150230/Pitchers_ERA/' using PigStorage(',');

When this statement is executed one part-r-00000 file is created in the Directory which contains the Output of the Reducer.


Hive Queries on every Table :

Batters :

File is located in the directory /user/gxd150230/Batter_Atbats/

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE batterAtbat(year string,id string,atbats int) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' LOCATION '/user/gxd150230/Batter_Atbats/';

Sample Query be like :

select * from batterAtbat where id LIKE '%suzukic01%';

Output :
2010    suzukic01       680
2011    suzukic01       677

Getting the Row with the maximum value for a particular attribute :
